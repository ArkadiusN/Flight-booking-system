# Flight-booking-system
Implementation of a flight booking system that considers different aspects of a successful and unsuccessful flight.
What this project does is it looks through the details of each pssenger and assigns a seat to this person. If there is 
no enough spaces in a given flight class they are either upgraded or downgraded. Once this is done,
the flight booking system checks details such as weight of the aircraft and then displays all details of flight accordingly.
